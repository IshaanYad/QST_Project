AI based tools (ChatGPT and Claude) were used as a supportive resource and to summarize the code and projct structure. 
The primary aim was to debug and to summarise the project.

Prompts used fo usinf AI
1). How can a neural network ensure that a density matrix is positive and its trace is 1 ?
2). How do i implement LL(^dagger) for density matrix using pytorch?
3). why does my model produce NaN while i am training it ?
4). how do i normalize a density matrix such that its trace becomes 1 ?
5). Summarize the project and create the directory structure as well as what the project is doing

The AI-assisted outputs were verified by running the changes/recommndations on a dummy model before incorporating them into the main code structure. 
The training was repeated in multiple iterations to check for convergence.
